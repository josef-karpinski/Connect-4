# Connect-4

This repository contains the code for a Connect-4 application that I developed as the final project for my AP Computer Science A course. 

Note: The code is written using Processing.org's Java library, which has its own IDE and file type of .pde. To edit these files and test the program, it is recommended that you download the Processing IDE.
